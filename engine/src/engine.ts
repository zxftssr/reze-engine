 * How far skinning can carry a vertex away from the bones that drive it.
 *
 * A skinned position is p = Σ wᵢ·(Mᵢv), and each Mᵢ is rigid (MMD bones do not
 * scale), so Mᵢv = pᵢ + Rᵢ(v − bᵢ) where pᵢ is bone i's posed position and bᵢ
 * its bind position. That splits p into a convex combination of the pᵢ — which
 * is inside their AABB — plus Σ wᵢ·Rᵢ(v − bᵢ), whose length is at most
 * Σ wᵢ·|v − bᵢ|. So an AABB over the posed bone positions, grown by the largest
 * such WEIGHTED SUM over all vertices, contains the whole mesh in any pose. The
 * per-model sphere is therefore derived, not guessed.
 *
 * The weighting is what makes it usable, and it took measuring real models to
 * see why. Bounding by max|v − bᵢ| over the influencing bones is also valid, and
 * on five MMD models it produced spheres 1.5–2.3× the model's own radius —
 * mostly air, and a character that never culls. The cause is always the same: a
 * stray 1/255 weight tying some vertex to a control bone parked at the origin
 * (全ての親, 操作中心, a glasses bone). Such a weight moves the vertex by
 * millimetres and must be charged for millimetres, which the weighted form does
 * and the max form does not. Weighted, the same models land at 1.35–1.45×.
 *
 * Weights are renormalized here exactly as the vertex shader renormalizes them,
 * including its fallback to joint 0 at full weight when they sum to zero — a
 * bound has to describe the vertex the shader will actually place.

   *     fn foreground(ray: vec3f, uv: vec2f, time: f32, depth: f32) -> vec4f
   *
   * `background` is a LAYER between the base background and the scene,
   * over-composited onto whichever base is active (solid color, 360 equirect, or
   * transparency) — its alpha lets the base show through, so a starfield is
   * stars over the user's background color. `foreground` composites over the
   * finished frame instead, which is where rain, snow, petals and fog live, and
   * is handed `depth`: the camera-space distance in metres of whatever the scene
   * drew at that pixel (the far plane where it drew nothing). Compare a
   * particle's own distance against it and the model occludes it; fog just reads
   * it, since fog's alpha IS a function of distance.
   *
   * `ray` is the pixel's normalized world-space view direction (LH, +Z forward —
   * what the skybox samples by), `uv` is 0..1 bottom-left origin, `time` is
   * seconds since apply, and `bgResolution()` gives the canvas size. Return sRGB
   * + alpha; alpha is the only "how much does this replace" control there is.
   * Declared `params` arrive as `params.<name>` (number → f32, Vec3 → vec3f),
   * shared by both mounts, and are later tweaked without recompiling via
   * setEffectParam.
   *
   * Both mounts are display-space: neither affects lighting, bloom or
   * tonemapping, and both are captured by offline export. A foreground makes the
   * scene pass STORE its depth buffer (it otherwise discards it into tile
   * memory) for as long as one is installed.
   *
   * Compiles off the hot path (async pipelines): on failure the previous effect
   * is KEPT and diagnostics are returned with line numbers relative to the

   * WHO IS IN. Only render-class "auto" with alpha-mode "opaque" — the body,
   * face and cloth materials that are the bulk of every model — plus every
   * ungrouped material (the neutral pipeline is that same class). WHO IS OUT,
   * each for a reason that would change pixels: EYE front-culls and gates on a
   * bone read, and pre-filled hair depth over the socket would depth-reject
   * the eye before it could write the stencil the see-through-hair pass needs
   * — which is also why HAIR stays out entirely. They all still BENEFIT:
   * their fragments early-z against the primed depth of whatever plain opaque
   * surface sits in front of them.
   *
   * HASHED alpha primes through the SOLID pipeline (cutoff 1.0). Its colour
   * pass discards by a position hash this pass does not run, but that threshold
   * is clamped to at most 1, so a texel at alpha exactly 1 survives it always —
   * those are the only texels the solid prime claims, and it can never punch
   * the cutout into the wrong ones. A stage's foliage and railings are mostly
