// A lawn standing in a character's shadow has to darken where the floor under
// it does, or the figure floats: the ground catcher draws her shadow, and the
// blades drawn over it hide it. And the shade has to be the SCENE'S shade — her
// shaded side takes the world's colour, and a lawn shaded by its own guess
// reads as a patch of different flowers beside her. Both are already computed
// for the materials every frame; this hands the same lookups to effects.
//
// Bound for real in the particle SHADING stage only. That is where geometry an
// effect draws inside the scene pass is shaded, and the shadow pass has already
// run by then. Every other module that compiles the author's file gets stubs:
// rzShadow answers 1, lit, which is what a point with no occlusion information
// is — the same answer sampleShadow gives outside every cascade — and
// rzWorldAmbient answers black, no light.
